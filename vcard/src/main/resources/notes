Three more entities (one enumeration), Phone, Vcard and Version (the 
enumeration). 

Added methods in VcardReader for handling these new entities.

Version 2.3

Encapsulation, public constructor for VcardReader replaced with static factory 
method.

Version 2.4 

Backward compatibility is broken again, so this should probably have been a new
major version.

Further encapsulation.
Immutability: Static factory methods (Phone, Photo), Builder (Vcard).

Exceptions thrown if revision or version is not found in the source.
